Attention, this web app on NEXT.JS & TAILWIND.CSS is only made for studies using the spotify API itself. By the time you log in, some device logged in with your account must be active, the web app will control the music through it. For copyright reasons it is not possible to play songs directly in the webapp. 
Thank you.
